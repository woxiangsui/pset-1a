      <h1>Concerts</h1>
      <p>Performing live as an utaite is not unusual feat. Although utaite are known for hiding their faces from the public, fans have a chance to see an utaite's face during their concerts. During the concert, fans are able to buy Mafumafu merchandise. Examples of merch would be, rings, folders, pins, stickers, light sticks, etc. <br> <h4>Mafumafu has had the oppurtunity to perform in the following places:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Mauhari Messe</li>
        <li>Saitama Super Area</li>
        <li>Metlife Dome</li>
        <li>Tokyo Dome</li>
      </ul> <img src="images/concert.jpg" alt="MafuMafu's concert" height="350"> <caption>Mafumafu's solo live concert at Metlife Dome.</caption> </p>
